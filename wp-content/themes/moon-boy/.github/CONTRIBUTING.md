## Submitting issues

Before submitting your issue, make sure it has not been discussed earlier. You can search for existing tickets [here](https://github.com/craigiswayne/MoonBoy/search).

Here are some tips to consider and to help you write a great report:

* `MoonBoy` supports Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 and Edge, as well as the latest two versions of all other major browsers.
* `MoonBoy` is backwards compatible with the two versions prior to the current stable version of WordPress.
* `MoonBoy` uses HTML5 markup.
* We decided not to include translations [[#50](https://github.com/craigiswayne/MoonBoy/pull/50)] beyond the existing `MoonBoy.pot` file, a RTL stylesheet [[#263](https://github.com/craigiswayne/MoonBoy/pull/263)], or editor styles [[#225](https://github.com/craigiswayne/MoonBoy/pull/225)], as they are likely to change during development of an `MoonBoy` based theme.
